# EcoCity 🌱

EcoCity is a full-stack web application that promotes smart waste classification and eco-conscious living in urban environments. The platform allows users to upload images of waste materials, receive classification results (Biodegradable / Non-Biodegradable), and locate nearby disposal centers. It aims to bridge the gap between household waste management and sustainable city living.
